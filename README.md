# Tetris-game
 In this project, the purpose was to successfully create a video game by implementation of things learnt from the beginning of the semester till now. I made heavy use of functions, classes and loops. I used features from the Turtle documentation and string manipulation methods for  string formatting. The assignment is detailed for the specific project application of making a video game. It describes the programâ€™s solution and the steps used to develop it in implementing a game design. Classes were used to make codes easier to be called and loops for rmaking codes shorter and concise.  After successfully completing my codes, written logically in order it worked exactly as expected with extremely many bugs which I fixed.

## Instructions # 
Key player interactions are arrow keys and spacebar to rotate the shape as desired. Here the class and functions are all working in place to run the game.
